<p>I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Bern, working with Walter Senn, Mihai Petrovici and Katharina Wilmes. Before that, I studied Neural Systems and Computation (MSc) at the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zürich. My interest is in deciphiring cortical computation, with the working hypothesis that it is based on a canonical motif repeated across areas and species (Kevin Martin). 

<p>Cortical circuits are composed of different cell types fulfilling distinct computational roles, and cortical connectivity can be efficiently recapitulated with a few blueprints of connnectivity between cell types and synaptic learning rules. I believe, these are structural constraints on the form our models should take (Matthew Cook). For a few years my focus has been on normative energy-based models (Walter Senn). From this period I keep a recreational interest in the application of differential geometry to energy-based models in neuroscience. My focus is now on a more bottom-up approach, with (i) the integration of emerging experimental data on this topic and (ii) the application of automatic search in the space of cell type connectivity, looking for functional architectures.

<p>Other interests include existentialist philosophy, in particular Camus, and cyberpunk and surreal animation cinema.</p>
