<h1>Arno Granier</h1>
<h3 id="email">arno [dot] granier [at] unibe [dot] ch</h3>
<p>I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Bern, working with Walter Senn, Mihai Petrovici and Katharina Wilmes. Before that, I studied Neural Systems and Computation (MSc) at the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zürich. My interest is in deciphiring cortical computation, with the working hypothesis that it is based on a canonical motif repeated across areas and species. For that hypothesis, I am very much intellectually indebted to Kevin Martin, even though we crossed only briefly in Zürich. The impressive feats of modern artificial intelligence show us that it is possible to have human-level performance across a range of cognitive tasks (language, visions, etc.) with a singular modular architecture.
	
I am interested in a mechanistic understanding of such canonical cortical algorithm, thus I focus on the level of abstraction of neural circuits. Cortical circuits are composed of different cell types fulfilling distinct computational roles, and cortical connectivity can be efficiently recapitulated with a few blueprints of connnectivity between cell types and synaptic learning rules. I believe, these are structural constraints on the form our models should take. My thinking on this topics has been shaped by discussions with Matthew Cook. I focus on searching this space of canonical cell type connectivity, from three differentl angles (i) automatic search, (ii) normative modeling, and (iii) matching emerging experimental data. Hopefully, these all converge. For a few years my focus has been on normative energy-based models, following Walter Senn. From this period I keep a recreational interest in the application of differential geometry to energy-based models in neuroscience. I found normative modelling in its current form quite incapable of producing a satisfactory account of the diversity of cortical cell types and their complex wiring, and I thus shifted to a more bottom-up, hands-on approach. My focus is now on the side of applying automatic search in the space of cell type connectivity, looking for functional architectures. To be fair, I also hope to extract some insights for a better suited normative approach from this hands-on approach.

Other interests include existentialist philosophy, in particular Camus, and cyberpunk and surreal animation cinema.
